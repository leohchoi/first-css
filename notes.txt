using the style command right inside the tags like <h1 style> is inline and should not do it 

using style command inside the head tag <head> <style> </head> is internal

using style command within a differnet file is external

as you can see, font size, font color, family all determine what kind of form the font takes

line height separates the text by the amt you want

as far as rules within html/css/browser, classes and id does the same thing but want to think of IDs as 
smt thats unqiue and not used anywhere else. e.g. a main nav bar will have id of main nav bar since you wont have 
another main nav bar.

but for classes, you may have a class called box-1 where you use the same style, border, etc somewhere else

to target a class inside css file, you do .class_name 

you want to use percentages instead of pixels when implementing container widths so that it responds properly
when you shrink and widen the page size

for margins, you have top, right, bottom, left margins. 
so you can declare as margin: 5px(top) 10px(right) 5px(bottom) 10px(left);
### goes clockwise

if top/bottom and right/left are the same, then you can declare margin: 5px 10px;

in css, you have the content, then there is the padding, then the border, then the margin. they all act as
some sort of margin between each other

using *{} at the top means that whatever you put in the {} affects every element in the css file. You may
want to use this to zero everything out to margin and padding to 0 so you dont have any confusion when starting smt

in links or other types of elements, you can use hover to make changes when cursor goes over that element or class or id
 
 with links, you can do visited, and active
