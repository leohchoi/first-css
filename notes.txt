using the style command right inside the tags like <h1 style> is inline and should not do it 

using style command inside the head tag <head> <style> </head> is internal

using style command within a differnet file is external

as you can see, font size, font color, family all determine what kind of form the font takes

line height separates the text by the amt you want

as far as rules within html/css/browser, classes and id does the same thing but want to think of IDs as 
smt thats unqiue and not used anywhere else. e.g. a main nav bar will have id of main nav bar since you wont have 
another main nav bar.

but for classes, you may have a class called box-1 where you use the same style, border, etc somewhere else

to target a class inside css file, you do .class_name
